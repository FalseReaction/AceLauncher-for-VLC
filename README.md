# AceLauncher-for-VLC
A small program that launches Ace Stream Engine, then asks you for an Ace Stream ID. It then converts the ID into a URL usable with VLC media player and opens it in VLC.

This program assumes that Ace Engine is installed in the default loction '%APPDATA%\ACEStream\engine\ace_engine.exe' and VLC (64bit) is installed in its default location 'C:\\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe'.

Currently provided as is.
